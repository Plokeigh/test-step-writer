MO-02,informal process,Inadequate Data Backup Process,"While Management performs some data backups for the system, the process lacks formalization and consistency in execution. Backups may be performed on an ad-hoc basis rather than consistently following the backup schedule. There isn't a structured process for reviewing backup logs to ensure successful completion, with reviews occurring inconsistently rather than on the required weekly cadence. Failed backups might be noted but are not consistently documented in a formal ticketing system, creating potential gaps in the audit trail and possibly allowing backup failures to go unaddressed. The organization could benefit from clearer roles and responsibilities for backup management, which would enhance oversight and accountability for this data protection control.","For the system(s) listed in column E, perform the following steps: 1. Establish a formal backup policy that clearly defines daily incremental and weekly full backup requirements for the system. 2. Implement automated backup scheduling to ensure consistent execution according to the defined schedule. 3. Develop a standardized process for reviewing backup logs periodically (we recommend weekly). 4. Create backup log review templates to document the completion and results of each periodic review. 5. Implement a formal ticketing process to document all backup failures, including failure details and resolution steps. 6. Define specific timeframes for addressing and resolving backup failures based on criticality. 7. Consider implementing automated monitoring tools that provide real-time alerts for backup failures.",
MO-02,gap,Absence of Data Backup Process,"Management does not currently maintain a formal backup process for the system, with no consistent back up schedule. There isn't a defined backup strategy or documented procedures for creating and maintaining data backups of this financially significant system. The organization has not assigned specific responsibility for backup management to any particular IT Personnel, resulting in limited oversight for this data protection function. No process exists for regularly reviewing backup logs or documenting backup failures, increasing the risk that data loss could occur without timely detection or mitigation. The absence of a robust backup system creates risk to business continuity and data integrity in the event of system failure, data corruption, or other disruptive events.","For the system(s) listed in column E, perform the following steps: 1. Establish a formal backup policy that clearly defines daily incremental and weekly full backup requirements for the system. 2. Implement a backup solution capable of performing the required backup schedule and retention requirements. 3. Designate specific administrators responsible for backup management and oversight. 4. Develop and document standardized procedures for executing and verifying backups. 5. Implement a formal process for periodic review of backup logs by the designated IT Personnel (we recommend weekly). 6.

MO-03,informal process,Inadequate Backup Restoration Testing,"While system backups are being performed for the system, the organization conducts limited and inconsistent testing of backup restoration capabilities. Restoration tests are performed on an ad-hoc basis rather than consistently following a periodic schedule (e.g., annually), with some periods potentially having no testing performed. When tests are conducted, they may involve only basic file-level restoration rather than comprehensive system recovery testing that would validate complete restoration is possible in a disaster scenario. Documentation of restoration tests is often minimal and inconsistent, sometimes lacking detailed information about the test procedures, results, anomalies encountered, or corrective actions taken. There are no formally defined success criteria to objectively evaluate restoration test results, making it more difficult to determine if the tests are effectively validating backup integrity and completeness.","For the system(s) listed in column E, perform the following steps: 1. Establish a formal periodic schedule for system backup restoration testing with specific testing dates. We recommend performing these tests semi-annually; however, the frequency can be risk-adjusted based on factors like data criticality and backup system reliability. 2. Develop comprehensive test scenarios that validate both file-level recovery and full system restoration capabilities. 3. Create detailed documentation templates for recording all aspects of restoration tests, including procedures followed, results obtained, anomalies identified, and corrective actions implemented. 4. Define clear success criteria for restoration tests to objectively evaluate whether backups are valid and complete. 5. Implement a ticketing system to formally document each periodic test and track any required remediation actions. 6. Establish timeframes for addressing any issues identified during restoration testing. 7. Assign specific responsibility for overseeing the periodic testing program and ensuring tests are performed as scheduled.",

ITELC-01,gap,Absence of Formal SOC Report Review Process,"Management does not currently perform a formal review of SOC 1 Type II reports for service organizations to systematically identify qualified opinions or exceptions in testing, resulting in potential unaddressed control deficiencies within these service organizations. There isn't an established process to identify and map complementary user entity controls (CUECs) from the service organizations' SOC 1 reports to controls within the company's environment, potentially leaving gaps in the control framework unidentified and unresolved. Management has not implemented procedures to systematically identify subservice organizations used by service providers, obtain their SOC 1 reports, or map complementary subservice organization controls (CSOCs) to ensure comprehensive coverage of the control environment. No consistent alternative monitoring mechanisms have been established in cases where SOC 1 reports may not be available, leaving the company with less assurance regarding the effectiveness of controls at service and subservice organizations.","For the system(s) listed in column E, perform the following steps: 1.

ITELC-01,informal process,Informal SOC Report Review Process,"Management occasionally reviews SOC 1 Type II reports for the service organization, but lacks a formalized, documented process with consistent methodology and comprehensive coverage. While SOC reports are sometimes obtained, the review is performed without structured templates or formal documentation of findings, making it more challenging to track identified exceptions, qualified opinions, or their resolution over time. Complementary user entity controls (CUECs) mentioned in SOC reports are reviewed in an ad-hoc manner, without systematic mapping to the company's internal control environment, potentially leaving control gaps unidentified and unaddressed. The current approach includes limited consideration of subservice organizations and their complementary subservice organization controls (CSOCs), with inconsistent efforts to obtain and review subservice SOC reports.
