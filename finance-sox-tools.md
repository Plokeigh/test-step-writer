# SOX Step Writer Tool

This document provides comprehensive information about the **SOX Step Writer** tool for processing SOX control information and generating test steps.

## Overview

The SOX Step Writer is a specialized tool that takes an Excel file containing SOX control information and automatically generates structured test steps and attributes formatted for GRC tool upload. It uses AI to analyze control descriptions, testing attributes, and evidence requirements to create comprehensive testing procedures.

## How It Works

### Input: Excel File with SOX Controls
Upload an Excel file with the following column structure:

| Column | Name | Description | Example |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
| A | Ref ID | Unique control identifier | ACT-AHA-01 |
| B | Control Description | Detailed description of the control | Monthly reconciliation of A&H Actuarial Database |
| C | Testing Attributes | List of testing procedures to verify control | Inspect query parameters, verify differences investigated |
| D | Design Attributes | Specific control design attributes | Data completeness verification, mathematical accuracy |
| E | Evidence of Control | Documentation that validates control operation | Query parameters, email confirmations, signed reports |

### Processing: AI-Powered Analysis
1. **Parse Excel Data**: Extracts control information from each row
2. **AI Analysis**: Analyzes each control's description, attributes, and evidence
3. **Test Step Generation**: Creates detailed, actionable test steps
